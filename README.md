## Notes
* Wrapping the Text with Center will allow the background color to take up full inside the container as
  by default Text will occ
  upy the text area and background color be limited to that, that's the reason Text need to be wrapped with Center widget.
* If the code is run in web browswer then padding between the button is not visible, but if run in the phone or the virtual sdk, it shows the padding automatically, but in case you need to have those padding in button in web browser just wrap the button with padding widget that will sove the issue
* Container provides margin property so we can wrap Column or Rows to allow margin in those column children widget.
